# 🏛️ Telugu Voice-Based Government Scheme AI Agent

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **voice-first AI assistant** designed to help **Telugu-speaking users** understand and apply for government welfare schemes.  
It enables users to **interact entirely through voice**, making it accessible for rural and non-English-speaking citizens.

The system demonstrates an **Agentic AI workflow** that can:
- Listen to Telugu speech
- Convert speech to text
- Reason over user input
- Respond intelligently
- Speak back in Telugu

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many government schemes fail to reach rural citizens due to:
- Language barriers
- Lack of digital literacy
- Complex application processes

This project addresses the problem by providing a **simple voice-based interface in Telugu**, allowing users to interact naturally without typing.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- 🎙️ **Voice-First Interaction** – Users speak in Telugu instead of typing
- 🧠 **Agentic Reasoning** – The agent can interpret user input and respond logically
- 🗣️ **Telugu Language Support** – Both input and output are in Telugu
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech Output** – Replies are spoken back to the user
- 🌐 **Browser-Based Microphone Capture** – Ensures reliability across systems
- 📁 **Modular Project Design** – Clean separation of UI, logic, and speech components
